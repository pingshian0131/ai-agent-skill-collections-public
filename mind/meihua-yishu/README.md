Meihua Yishu (梅花易數 / Plum Blossom Numerology / Plum Blossom I Ching) is a traditional Chinese I Ching divination method, attributed to Shao Yong (邵雍) of the Song Dynasty. This project provides a professional Meihua divination system as an AI Skill for Claude Code.

> Also known as: 梅花易数 (Simplified Chinese), Mei Hua Yi Shu, Plum Blossom Oracle, 梅花心易

## Why Meihua Yishu?

### A Decision-Making Framework, Not Fortune-Telling

Unlike popular misconceptions about divination, Meihua Yishu is a structured thinking tool rooted in 3,000 years of Chinese philosophical wisdom:

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "Predicts the future" | Analyzes present conditions and likely trajectories |
| "Superstition" | Systematic framework based on pattern recognition |
| "Magic" | Philosophical method for examining situations from multiple angles |

### Benefits

🎯 Decision Clarity — When facing complex choices, the hexagram structure forces you to consider factors you might overlook

🔄 Multiple Perspectives — The Ti-Yong (体用) framework systematically examines self vs. environment, action vs. reaction

⏱️ Timing Awareness — The 應期 (Yingqi) system encourages thinking about *when* to act, not just *what* to do

🌊 Change Philosophy — Based on the I Ching principle that everything changes; helps accept uncertainty and plan adaptively

💭 Reflection Tool — The divination process creates space for introspection and deeper thinking about your situation

### Who Uses It?

- Entrepreneurs — For strategic timing and partnership decisions
- Individuals — For major life choices (career, relationships, relocation)
- Curious Minds — To explore Eastern philosophy and symbolic thinking
- Developers — To integrate traditional wisdom into AI applications

### The Meihua Advantage

Compared to other I Ching methods:
- Faster — No coins or yarrow stalks needed; cast from time, numbers, or observation
- More Intuitive — Trigram-based (8 symbols) rather than full hexagram memorization (64 symbols)
- Contextual — Ti-Yong analysis relates directly to your specific situation
- Practical — Clear auspicious/inauspicious framework with actionable insights

> *"The Yi does not predict fate — it reveals patterns. Understanding patterns empowers better choices."*

## Core Principles

### Yi = Change (易 = 變)

The fundamental principle of I Ching is change. The purpose of divination is not just to predict fortune, but to guide optimal action:

- Able to change = Auspicious (proactive adjustment, flow with circumstances)
- Unable to change = Inauspicious (stuck in place, missing opportunities)
- Staying in a bad position without changing = 0% success rate
- Proactive change = average 44% improvement in outcomes

Every divination must include strategy guidance — telling the querent what to do next.

### Early Heaven Bagua Numbers

Meihua Yishu uses Early Heaven Bagua Numbers:

| Trigram | Number | Element | Symbol |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| Qian (乾) | 1 | Metal | ☰ |
| Dui (兌) | 2 | Metal | ☱ |
| Li (離) | 3 | Fire | ☲ |
| Zhen (震) | 4 | Wood | ☳ |
| Xun (巽) | 5 | Wood | ☴ |
| Kan (坎) | 6 | Water | ☵ |
| Gen (艮) | 7 | Earth | ☶ |
| Kun (坤) | 8 | Earth | ☷ |

### Ti-Yong Theory

- Ti (体): The subject, self, the querent
- Yong (用): The object, matter, external environment
- Mutual Hexagram (互卦): The development process
- Transformed Hexagram (變卦): The final outcome

### Fortune Determination

| Situation | Fortune | Explanation |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Yong generates Ti | Very Auspicious | Gaining benefits, external assistance |
| Ti controls Yong | Auspicious | You control the situation, success likely |
| Ti-Yong in harmony | Auspicious | Same element, harmonious and smooth |
| Yong controls Ti | Inauspicious | Constrained by others, unfavorable |
| Ti generates Yong | Draining | Much effort, little return |

### Tongguan Mediation (通關化解)

When Ti and Yong are in a controlling relationship, a "bridging" element in the Mutual or Transformed hexagram can mitigate the inauspicious outcome:

| Controlling Relationship | Bridging Element |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| Metal controls Wood | Water |
| Wood controls Earth | Fire |
| Earth controls Water | Metal |
| Water controls Fire | Wood |
| Fire controls Metal | Earth |

## Divination Principles

1. No question, no divination — Don't divine without a specific question
2. No more than three times — Don't repeat divination for the same question more than three times
3. No movement, no divination — Don't divine without cause
4. Interpret with reason — Hexagrams must be interpreted in context
